Plugin for Blumentals WeBuilder/RapidPHP/RapidCSS/HTMLPad editors

This is a plugin for the following editors:

Webuilder: http://www.webuilderapp.com/<br/>
RapidPHP: http://www.rapidphpeditor.com/<br/>
RapidCSS: https://www.rapidcsseditor.com/<br/>
HTMLPad: https://www.htmlpad.net/


#### Function:
Allows you to run Gulp tasks directly from within the editor.
Plugin creates a new docking panel with various options to run Gulp tasks.


Since I couldn't find anyone to help betatest this plugin, the following is missing:

- Documentation. You'll have to figure out how to use the plugin yourself. (Hint: There's several context menus.)
- Plugin dependency check. Again you'll have to figure out what is required by yourself.
- Default gulpfile.js - I haven't bothered optimizing this or make different setups.


#### Installation:
1) Download plugin .ZIP file.
2) Open editor and select "Plugins -> Manage Plugins" from the menu.
3) Click "Install" and select the .ZIP file you downloaded in step 1.
