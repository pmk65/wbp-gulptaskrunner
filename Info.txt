WeBuilder Plugin: [b]Gulp Taskrunner v1.0[/b]
(Requires 2018 version of editor)


Allows you to run Gulp tasks directly from within the editor.
Plugin creates a new docking panel with various options to run Gulp tasks.

Since I couldn't find anyone to help betatest this plugin, the following is missing:

- Documentation. You'll have to figure out how to use the plugin yourself. (Hint: There's several context menus.)
- Plugin dependency check. Again you'll have to figure out what is required by yourself.
- Default gulpfile.js - I haven't bothered optimizing this or make different setups.


[b]Installation:[/b]
1) Download plugin .ZIP file.
2) Open WeBuilder and select "Plugins -> Manage Plugins" from the menu.
3) Click "Install" and select the .ZIP file you downloaded in step 1.

Feedback appreciated. ;)
(I only use WeBuilder, so I haven't tested if it works in HTMLPad, Rapid CSS or Rapid PHP.)
